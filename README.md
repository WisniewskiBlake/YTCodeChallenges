* The problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten
 each other (they will not be able to attack each other)


 * We need to consider that queens can move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally


 * Dijkstra used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called structured programming
